# NetBoost Pro - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** NetBoost Pro  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Platform:** Windows 11 (with future expansion to macOS and Linux)  
**Technology Stack:** Rust + Windows UI Framework  
**Project Type:** System-level network optimization application  

NetBoost Pro is a revolutionary network optimization application that creates a virtual network interface to intelligently combine and manage multiple physical network connections (Ethernet, WiFi, cellular, etc.) to deliver superior internet performance, reduced latency, and enhanced reliability. The application operates transparently at the system level, requiring no configuration from individual applications or third-party proxy solutions.

## 2. Product Overview
